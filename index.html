            My name is Bill Wunsch and I live in the Roscoe Village neighborhood of Chicago with my beautiful wife Lisa. We were married
            on June 2, 2018 on an Amish farm in Indiana. While I've only lived in Chicago for 7 years, she's lived here for nearly 15. 
            She's a video producer and currently works at a two person company. We are both big college football fans. She's a Notre Dame 
            fan and I am not so during college football season Saturday's can be fairly tense in our household. I'm a fan of Iowa State and LSU.
        </p>

            We have two dogs, a golden retriever named Louie and a black lab mix name Bailey. They are both 9 years old and I've had
            them for most of their lives. They can be both lazy and have a ton of energy at the same time which can make
            for interesting days.
